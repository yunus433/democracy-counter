A few weeks ago, Turkey held national elections, and a significant majority of active Turkish citizens (93% out of 64 million) participated in the voting process. While there are generally no concerns about anonymous voting, there are significant doubts about the transparency of the **vote counting process**. Following the vote count, we faced miscommunication issues that resulted in fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) when registering the vote results to the central database.

To address these challenges, we are introducing a transparency protocol that ensures the integrity of the voting counting and registering process. This protocol provides trackability, allowing for the recording and monitoring of actions performed by authorized individuals throughout the entire process.

Key problems our protocol solves include:

- Difficulty in tracking disputes among party auditors.
- Inaccurate results from ballot boxes and announcements.
- Instances of lost votes during result delivery, leading to unverifiable claims about result inaccuracies.
- The occurrence of FUD related to the election safety due to a lack of real-time "verified" results.

We are providing a protocol to register all authorizations and actions and limiting it in contract level. 
It results in:

- tracking elections real-time on transparent open-source platform
- providetransparency at every step. proactive - active fraud detection
- mitigating risks of fraud and manipulation through since we collects all auditors data as immutable.
- reducing the data loss stems from centralized systems / single point of failure
